# `create_branding`


## Project Description

An app that uses LLMS to: 

* Generate a `_brand.yml` file after taking user inputs of company/personal branding. [This article](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/articles/llm-brand-yml-prompt/) shows how to prompt an LLM.  
* Generate `ggplot2` themes and scales using the information from the generated `_brand.yml` file.  
* Create a package structure that wraps the branding, scales, themes, etc. `fusen` package seems to be a decent way to do this.  

Such a package may look something like the [`brandsw` example package](https://github.com/durraniu/brandsw).

Other features might include:  

* A package structure for Python.   
* Creating a quarto extension for the yaml file.   


### Challenges

How to use LLMs in the app? Some possibilities:  

* Use cloudflare workers AI models. Many models in beta are free to use with no limits. Other models have generous limits.  
* Ask the user for their key.
