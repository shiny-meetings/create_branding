# `create_branding`

## Project Description

An app that uses LLMS to:

- Generate a `_brand.yml` file after taking user inputs of
  company/personal branding. [This
  article](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/articles/llm-brand-yml-prompt/)
  shows how to prompt an LLM.  
- Generate `ggplot2` themes and scales using the information from the
  generated `_brand.yml` file.  
- Create a package structure that wraps the branding, scales, themes,
  etc. `fusen` package seems to be a decent way to do this.

Such a package may look something like the [`brandsw` example
package](https://github.com/durraniu/brandsw).

Other features might include:

- A package structure for Python.  
- Creating a quarto extension for the yaml file.

### Challenges

How to use LLMs in the app? Some possibilities:

- Use cloudflare workers AI models. Many models in beta are free to use
  with no limits. Other models have generous limits.  
- Ask the user for their key.

## Meetings
